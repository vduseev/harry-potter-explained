# Harry Potter magic explained!

This website is a collection of explanations for the magic in the Harry Potter universe. It is a work in progress, and will be updated as I write more articles. It has no basis in canon, and is purely my own interpretation of the magic in the Harry Potter universe. The articles are written in a way that assumes you have read the books, and will contain spoilers. The goal is to explain the magic in a way that makes sense, and to fill in the gaps left by the books.

## Contribute

If you want to improve this website in any way, feel free to open an issue, or even better, a pull request! I'm happy about every contribution!
