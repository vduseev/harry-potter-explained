## Hello

My name is Vagiz Duseev, I am a [software engineer](https://linkedin.com/in/vduseev) in my free time and a professional Harry Potter scholar in my working hours. I am a big fan of the Harry Potter universe and all the magic that is happening there.

I always theorized a lot about the Harry Potter universe and had many ideas about how to explain it. At some point my friends told me that I should start writing about it.

Harry Potter is a great universe to explore and I am happy to share my thoughts with you. I hope you will enjoy it.

## About this website

This website is a collection of explanations for the magic in the Harry Potter universe. It is a work in progress, and will be updated as I write more articles. It is mostly based on movies nad books, and is purely my own interpretation of the magic in the Harry Potter universe. The articles are written in a way that assumes you have watched the movies, and will contain spoilers. The goal is to explain the magic in a way that makes sense, and to fill in the gaps left by the books.
