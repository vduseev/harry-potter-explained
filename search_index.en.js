time and a professional Harry Potter scholar in my working hours. I am a big fan of the Harry Potter universe and all the magic that is happening there.\nI always theorized a lot about the Harry Potter universe and had many ideas about how to explain it. At some point my friends told me that I should start writing about it.\nHarry Potter is a great universe to explore and I am happy to share my thoughts with you. I hope you will enjoy it.\nAbout this website\nThis website is a collection of explanations for the magic in the Harry Potter universe. It is a work in progress, and will be updated as I write more articles. It is mostly based on movies nad books, and is purely my own interpretation of the magic in the Harry Potter universe. The articles are written in a way that assumes you have watched the movies, and will contain spoilers. The goal is to explain the magic in a way that makes sense, and to fill in the gaps left by the books.\nContributing\nIf you want to improve this website in any way, feel free to open an issue, or even better, a pull request!

It could be that it exists across universe and\nthere were other civilizations that used magic before humans.\n\nBeing an engineer, it’s really easy to notice how similar magic is to\nthe technology that we are using every day. Some of the things we use\nare indistinguishable from magic.\nTake Large Language Models (LLMs) for example. At this point you can tweak\nthem to behave just like a ghost from the Harry Potter universe: they can\nanswer questions, they can talk to you, they can teach history and even\ntalk endlessly about failing to join the “Headless Hunt”.\n\n  \n\nLetter from the Ministry of Magic notifying Harry that he was expelled.\nSame LLMs could act like any “sentient” being from the Harry Potter universe\nthat is not actually sentient, but is just a program that is very good at\nimitating a sentient being. For example, talking portraits, paintings and\nletters from Hogwarts, Sorting Hat, as well as other artifacts.\nWe, humans, program incredibly complex systems that can do things that are indistinguishable from magic.\n\n  \n\nModern computer schematics look like occult diagrams\nOne could argue that all the diagrams that physicists, mathematicians,\ncomputer scientists and engineers draw all the time are unbelieavably\nsimilar to occult pentagrams and runes that are created to summon electricity\nin such a way that it makes metal alive!\n\n  \n\nArtur Weasley is fascinated by the London Tube gate\nIt is impossible to explain anything in the magic world without accepting one\nof the theories presented below.\nEach theory attempts to explain the nature of magic as if it exists in our world.\nTheory 1: It’s all a simulation\nThis theory is based on the assumption that we are living in a simulation.\nI hate this theory, because it is a cop-out. It is a way to explain anything.\nThe whole universe becomes a game engine.\nHowever, some of the things that happen in the Harry Potter universe are\nextremely hard to explain without this theory. For example:\n\n\nTime travel\n\nInstant teleportation\n\nThe fact that light behaves both as a particle and as a wave in our world\nbut looks like wave from distance and like a particle when photon is\nobserved is a good example of how our world could be a simulation.\nIt’s like a game engine saving precious resources and optimizing physics by\na wave function because it makes no difference. But as soon as we start\nobserving individual particles it suddenly changes their physics and they\nloose their wave function.\nTheory 2: It’s all anceint technology\nThis theory is based on the writings of Elizer Yudkowsky in his rationality\nseries. It is a very interesting theory that explains the nature of magic\nas a technology that was created by an ancient Atlantis civilization\nthat existed long time ago and was destroyed by a catastrophe or left the planet.\nThey also invented a language that is used to program magic. The book\nassumes that magic is stored some energy source that are powering the\nwhole magical world.\nI kind of like this theory. It would explain a lot. Seeing what we are\ncurrently capabl of does make one wonder if people didn’t already arrive\nat the same level of technology in the past. And then even surpassed it.\nReminds a lot of the Warhammer 40k universe. It’s a very interesting\nsetting that is based on the idea that in year 30,000 humanity has\nreach the peak of its technological development but then things unraveled\nand in year 40,000 nobody remembers how to build anything advanced anymore.\nTheory 3: It’s a real part of the universe\nIt plays fundamental role in making the universe work and explains some\nof the things physics can’t explain. It might even be a consious entity.\nIn order to control the magic, not only you need to be human but you also\nneed to know the language and must be able to control magic with your mind.\n","id":"https://harrypotterexplained.com/articles/magic/","title":"How Magic Works"},"https://harrypotterexplained.com/articles/mirror-of-erised/":{"body":"\n  \n\nIn the enchanting corridors of the wizarding world, few artifacts have captured the imagination quite like the Mirror of Erised.
