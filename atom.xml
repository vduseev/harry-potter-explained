&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-magic&quot;&gt;What is magic?&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding of the nature of magic is the most fundamental and at the same
time the most complicated question in the Harry Potter universe.
I make several important assumptions about the nature of magic right from the
start and every explanation on this website is based on these assumptions.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Magic is very similar to programming.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All existing physical laws from our world still apply.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Magic has always existed. It could be that it exists across universe and
there were other civilizations that used magic before humans.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being an engineer, it’s really easy to notice how similar magic is to
the technology that we are using every day. Some of the things we use
are indistinguishable from magic.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take Large Language Models (LLMs) for example. At this point you can tweak
them to behave just like a ghost from the Harry Potter universe: they can
answer questions, they can talk to you, they can teach history and even
talk endlessly about failing to join the “Headless Hunt”.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

  &#x2F;&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;Letter from the Ministry of Magic notifying Harry that he was expelled.&lt;&#x2F;figcaption&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Same LLMs could act like any “sentient” being from the Harry Potter universe
that is not actually sentient, but is just a program that is very good at
imitating a sentient being. For example, talking portraits, paintings and
letters from Hogwarts, Sorting Hat, as well as other artifacts.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We, humans, program incredibly complex systems that can do things that are indistinguishable from magic.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

    &quot;
    alt=&quot;Computer schematics&quot;
    src=&quot;occult-diagrams.png&quot;
  &#x2F;&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;Modern computer schematics look like occult diagrams&lt;&#x2F;figcaption&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One could argue that all the diagrams that physicists, mathematicians,
computer scientists and engineers draw all the time are unbelieavably
similar to occult pentagrams and runes that are created to summon electricity
in such a way that it makes metal alive!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

  &#x2F;&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is impossible to explain anything in the magic world without accepting one
of the theories presented below.
Each theory attempts to explain the nature of magic as if it exists in our world.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;theory-1-it-s-all-a-simulation&quot;&gt;Theory 1: It’s all a simulation&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This theory is based on the assumption that we are living in a simulation.
I hate this theory, because it is a cop-out. It is a way to explain anything.
The whole universe becomes a game engine.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, some of the things that happen in the Harry Potter universe are
extremely hard to explain without this theory. For example:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;input disabled=&quot;&quot; type=&quot;checkbox&quot; checked=&quot;&quot;&#x2F;&gt;
Time travel&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;input disabled=&quot;&quot; type=&quot;checkbox&quot; checked=&quot;&quot;&#x2F;&gt;
Instant teleportation&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact that light behaves both as a particle and as a wave in our world
but looks like wave from distance and like a particle when photon is
observed is a good example of how our world could be a simulation.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s like a game engine saving precious resources and optimizing physics by
a wave function because it makes no difference. But as soon as we start
observing individual particles it suddenly changes their physics and they
loose their wave function.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;theory-2-it-s-all-anceint-technology&quot;&gt;Theory 2: It’s all anceint technology&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This theory is based on the writings of Elizer Yudkowsky in his rationality
series. It is a very interesting theory that explains the nature of magic
as a technology that was created by an ancient Atlantis civilization
that existed long time ago and was destroyed by a catastrophe or left the planet.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They also invented a language that is used to program magic. The book
assumes that magic is stored some energy source that are powering the
whole magical world.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I kind of like this theory. It would explain a lot. Seeing what we are
currently capabl of does make one wonder if people didn’t already arrive
at the same level of technology in the past. And then even surpassed it.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reminds a lot of the Warhammer 40k universe. It’s a very interesting
setting that is based on the idea that in year 30,000 humanity has
reach the peak of its technological development but then things unraveled
and in year 40,000 nobody remembers how to build anything advanced anymore.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;theory-3-it-s-a-real-part-of-the-universe&quot;&gt;Theory 3: It’s a real part of the universe&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It plays fundamental role in making the universe work and explains some
of the things physics can’t explain. It might even be a consious entity.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to control the magic, not only you need to be human but you also
need to know the language and must be able to control magic with your mind.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

    alt=&quot;Mirror of Erised&quot;
    src=&quot;mirror.png&quot;
  &#x2F;&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the enchanting corridors of the wizarding world, few artifacts have captured the imagination quite like the Mirror of Erised. This beguiling and unusual magical object stands as a testament to the complex nature of desire and the human heart. Adorned with an inscription that reads in reverse, it reveals not the viewer’s face but their innermost yearnings, often hidden even from themselves. The mirror, with its ornate frame and ancient aura, offers a glimpse into a realm where reality intertwines with the most desperate wishes of our hearts, serving as a mirror to the soul rather than the physical form.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what arcane enchantments empower this mirror to delve into the psyche and conjure up such personal revelations? And what can its existence tell us about the nature of magic itself, which seems to transcend the boundaries of mere spells and potions? Join me as we embark on a journey to understand the intricate magic behind the Mirror of Erised, unraveling the fabric of its enchantment and the principles that allow such a mystical experience. Let’s dive into the reflective depths of this extraordinary artifact and explore the physics of the possible within the wizarding realm.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-do-we-know-about-the-mirror-of-erised&quot;&gt;What do we know about the Mirror of Erised?&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Mirror of Erised is a tall, ornate mirror with a gold frame and clawed feet. It is adorned with an inscription in an unknown language, which reads in reverse and can only be deciphered when reflected in the mirror itself. The mirror is said to have been created by a mysterious wizard named Erised, who lived in a remote village in the fifteenth century. Erised was a recluse who rarely left his home, and he died in his sleep shortly after the mirror was completed. The mirror was passed down through the generations of his family, and eventually came into the possession of Albus Dumbledore, who kept it in his office at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-attributes-does-the-mirror-of-erised-possess&quot;&gt;What attributes does the Mirror of Erised possess?&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;input disabled=&quot;&quot; type=&quot;checkbox&quot;&#x2F;&gt;
Shows the viewer their deepest desires&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;input disabled=&quot;&quot; type=&quot;checkbox&quot;&#x2F;&gt;
Can display concurrent images for multiple viewers&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;input disabled=&quot;&quot; type=&quot;checkbox&quot;&#x2F;&gt;
Can be reprogrammed to behave in certain ways&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
