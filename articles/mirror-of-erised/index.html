It is adorned with an inscription in an unknown language, which reads in reverse and can only be deciphered when reflected in the mirror itself. The mirror is said to have been created by a mysterious wizard named Erised, who lived in a remote village in the fifteenth century. Erised was a recluse who rarely left his home, and he died in his sleep shortly after the mirror was completed. The mirror was passed down through the generations of his family, and eventually came into the possession of Albus Dumbledore, who kept it in his office at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.<h2 id=what-attributes-does-the-mirror-of-erised-possess>What attributes does the Mirror of Erised possess?</h2><ul><li><input disabled type=checkbox> Shows the viewer their deepest desires<li><input disabled type=checkbox> Can display concurrent images for multiple viewers<li><input disabled type=checkbox> Can be reprogrammed to behave in certain ways</ul><h2>Read Next</h2><a class=link-page href=https://harrypotterexplained.com/articles/magic/> How Magic Works </a><h2>Read Previous</h2><a class=link-page href=https://harrypotterexplained.com/articles/harrys-protection/> Why Harry Potter is protected from Voldemort </a><p class=dialog-buttons><a class=inline-button href=#top>Go to top</a> <a href=https://github.com/vduseev/harry-potter-explained/issues>Request a correction</a></div><footer class=footer><p title="Last built at 2023-12-09 21:03 +00:00">© Harry Potter Explained, Vagiz Duseev, 2022-2023</footer>
